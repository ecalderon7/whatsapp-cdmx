## 🔥 Critical Blockers (PoC Phase)

### PoC Infrastructure Dependencies
1. **AWS Account Setup** - Need Connect instance provisioning (1-2 days)
2. **WhatsApp Business API** - Meta approval required (3-7 days for test account)
3. **Test Phone Number** - Business verification for WABA (2-3 days)
4. **AWS IAM Configuration** - Permissions for Connect + End User Messaging

### PoC Validation Risks
1. **Connect + WABA Integration** - Unknown compatibility or limitations
2. **Message Latency** - Real-world performance may not meet requirements
3. **CCP User Experience** - May not be suitable for news team workflow
4. **Cost Implications** - Connect pricing for chat-only usage unclear

### Decision Dependencies
1. **PoC Results** - Full MVP only proceeds if PoC successful
2. **Alternative Solutions** - Need backup plan if Connect doesn't work
3. **Budget Approval** - PoC costs vs full implementation budget
4. **Timeline Impact** - PoC failure could delay project significantly

## 📈 Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK 🔴
- **Meta API Approval Delays**: Could block entire timeline
- **Team Adoption**: Resistance to change from WhatsApp Web
- **AWS Cost Overruns**: No cost monitoring implemented yet

### MEDIUM RISK 🟡  
- **Integration Complexity**: Connect + Amplify + DynamoDB coordination
- **Performance at Scale**: Untested with 8+ concurrent users
- **Data Migration**: Moving from existing WhatsApp history

### LOW RISK 🟢
- **Technical Feasibility**: Well-documented AWS stack
- **Development Skills**: Standard React/AWS technologies
- **Backup Solutions**: Multiple fallback options available

## 📝 Notes for Development Team

### Critical Path Items
1. Start Meta API approval process immediately (longest lead time)
2. AWS infrastructure must be production-ready before code deployment
3. Team training should begin as soon as basic functionality is available
4. Maintain WhatsApp Web as fallback until full validation

### Communication Plan
- **Daily standups**: Development progress and blocker identification  
- **Weekly demos**: Stakeholder updates with working functionality
- **Bi-weekly reviews**: Timeline and scope adjustments as needed

*This status report should be updated weekly as implementation progresses.*
